# GraphColoringPy

Graph Coloring using WelshPowell and backtracking algorithm

## Dependencies
1) Python 3
2) Matplotlib
3) Networkx

Run below command to install dependecies.
```
pip install matplotlib networkx
```

## Input Format
Our program accepts input from a file named *input.txt* which has structure as described below.
First line contains space seperates integers which represents number of vertices and edges respectively.
Then next *e* lines contains space seperated integers u and v which represents edge between vertex u and v.

## How to run?
python tester.py 

## Output Format
Our program produces two graph images with different vertex colors as acquired by the welsh powell and backtracking algorithm respectively.
